[VLANS]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max> tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation.
# network_vlan_ranges = default:1000:2999

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/quantum_linux_bridge
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)
sql_connection = sqlite://
# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - in event connectivity is lost
reconnect_interval = 2

[LINUX_BRIDGE]
# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_interface> tuples mapping physical
# network names to agent's node-specific physical network
# interfaces. Server uses physical network names for validation but
# ignores interfaces.
# physical_interface_mappings = default:eth1

[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
polling_interval = 2
# Change to "sudo quantum-rootwrap" to limit commands that can be run
# as root.
root_helper = sudo
# Use RPC messaging to interface between agent and plugin
# rpc = True
