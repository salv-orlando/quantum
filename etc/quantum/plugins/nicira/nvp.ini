# This parameter describes a connection to a single NVP controller. Format:

# <ip> is the ip address of the controller
# <port> is the port of the controller (default NVP port is 443)
# <user> is the user name for this controller
# <pw> is the user password.
# <req_timeout>: The total time limit on all operations for a controller
#   request (including retries, redirects from unresponsive controllers).
#   Default is 30.
# <http_timeout>: How long to wait before aborting an unresponsive controller
#   (and allow for retries to another controller in the cluster).
#   Default is 10.
# <retries>: the maximum number of times to retry a particular request
#   Default is 2.
# <redirects>: the maximum number of times to follow a redirect response from a server.
#   Default is 2.
